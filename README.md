## Overview

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. A fleet of aliens fill the screen and move across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. Hitting an alien increments your score, located on the top right. If the player shoots all the aliens, your level increases. A new fleet appears and moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

* The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
